# ðŸ’¡ IoT Smart Home Light System

### Description:
A simulation of a smart home lighting system using Arduino UNO, motion sensors, and LEDs. This project was done as part of my IoT practical.

### Tech Used:
- Arduino UNO
- TinkerCAD for simulation
- IR Sensor / Motion Sensor
- LED Bulb

### Output:
When motion is detected, the LED lights turn on automatically. After 5 seconds of no motion, the lights turn off.

### Files:
- `circuit_diagram.png` â€” diagram
- `code.ino` â€” Arduino code for motion sensing light control

### Skills:
IoT, Smart Systems, Practical Thinking
